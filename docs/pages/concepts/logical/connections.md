## Managed and Unmanaged Connections
Each Meshplay Model can contain one more ConnectionDefinitions (files), each Definition representing one Connection, and also, (as a matter of convenience multiple Connections can be described in the same ConnectionDefinition file).

Connections can be:

1) a ConnectionDefinition based Meshplay's [Connection Schema](https://github.com/khulnasoft/schemas/blob/master/openapi/schemas/connections.yml) with hand-curated Connection attributes. 
2) a custom ConnectionDefinition based Meshplay's Connection Schema that references an existing Component within the same Model.

### Managed Connections

### Unmanaged Connections

<!-- Add about managed and unmanaged connections, state diff b/w maanged and munamanaged -->
## States and the Lifecycle of Connections

Every connection can be in one of the below mentioned states at any given point of time. To better understand these states, consider you have a `Kubernetes` cluster with `Prometheus` already installed.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/lifecycle-management/states-for-kubernetes-cluster-connections.svg)

### 1. Discovered

All resources discovered by [MeshSync's](meshsync.md) multi-tier discovery or provided as part of config, and if Meshplay can integrate, a connection with state as `Discovered` will be created. Though, the connection/resources are not tested for its reachability/usability i.e. Meshplay has not made an attempt to connect or manage the connection.

When a connection has been discovered, it will be listed in the MeshSync browser / Connections table in Meshplay UI. You can self transition a particular connection to [Register](#2-registered) / [Ignore](#4-ignored) state.

> Example: MeshSync discovers Prometheus components and inform Meshplay Server about available Prometheus connection, but Meshplay is yet to [connect](#3-connected) and start scraping metrics.

### 2. Registered

The connection in this state have been verified for its use and reachability but not yet being used. Almost all reachable connections will auto transition to Registered state from [Discovered](#1-discovered) state and it is upto the user what to do with this connection (i.e. User needs to administratively process the connection). It can be transitioned to [Connected](#3-connected), [Maintenance](#5-maintenance) and [Not Found](#8-not-found).

> EExampleg: User manually selects the registered Prometheus connection and transition to the [connected](#3-connected) state (i.e. User administratively processes the connection).

### 3. Connected

The connection in this state is administratively processed and being actively managed by Meshplay. User can interface and invoke set of actions with the connection.</br>
From this state the transition can happen to either [Maintenance](#5-maintenance) or [Ignore](#4-ignored) state. </br> Auto transition to [Disconnected](#6-disconnected) state will occur if Meshplay can no longer communicate with the connection, which can occur due to connectivity issue/AuthN-AuthZ/connection was deleted outside Meshplay or any other issue.

> Example: Meshplay is communicating with Prometheus APIs to scrape metrics and present it in the UI.

_Certain connections can auto-transition to connected state._

### 4. Ignored

The connection is administratively processed to be ignored from Meshplay's view of management. Meshplay will not re-discover this connection even when current user session gets expired.

> Example: Meshplay server will stop/not scrape metrics from Prometheus. Though, the previous data (if connected previously) will continue to exist and user needs to manually delete.

{% include alert.html type="info" title="Ignored versus Disconnected" content="You might intentionally choose to have Meshplay ignore a given Prometheus connection, explicitly leaving in Meshplayâ€™s field of view, but identifying it as a connection not to manage. This is distinctly different than a Prometheus that Meshplay was managing, but has been turned off/uninstalled and now Meshplay is disconnected from the Prometheus." %}

### 5. Maintenance

The connection is administratively processed to be offline for maintenance tasks. This is different from being [Disconnected](#6-disconnected)/[Ignored](#4-ignored).

### 6. Disconnected

The connection was previously [discovered](#1-discovered)/[registered](#2-registered)/[connected](#3-connected) but is not available currently. This could happen due to connectivity issue/AuthN-AuthZ/connection was deleted outside meshplay/administratively disconnected.

> Example: Prometheus crashed/API token provided at time of registration is revoked.

{% include alert.html type="info" title="Disconnected vs Deleted" content="The connection was previously connected but is unreachable due to connectivity issue/AuthN-AuthZ/connection was **deleted outside Meshplay** i.e. Connection was deleted beyond the Meshplay's view of management." %}

### 7. Deleted

The connection is administratively processed to be deleted and removed from Meshplay's view of management. All the available/collected data will also be deleted.

> Example: Prometheus metrics will no longer be accessible to you from the Meshplay UI.

### 8. Not Found

User tried registering the connection **manually** but Meshplay could not connect to it or if the connection is unavailable now. User can delete the connection or try re-registering.

{% include alert.html type="info" title="Not Found vs Disconnected" content="You might attempt to transition to Connected state but the connection is unavaialble now due to being deleted/some other reason. This is distinctly different than a cluster with Prometheuses installed for `application monitoring` which was connected previously but is now unreachable from Meshplay's view of management due to change in API token/similar issue." %}

_Connections like **Registration of Meshplay server with remote provider** (and few other connection types) can self transtion to the valid states._
