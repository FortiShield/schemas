As an cloud native management platform, Meshplay has built-in support infastructure and application configuration management. Use Meshplay to configure your multi-cluster Kubernetes environments on-premises or across clouds.

## What is a Meshplay Design?

Meshplay's core construct of configuration management is that of a design. A design is ultimately a document â€“ and a document in which you capture and describe your desired state of improv the environment.

## Creating a Meshplay Design

You have your choice of how are you would like to create an infrastructure design. You can use the design configurator inside of measure, UI or extensions, like MeshMap, or you can hand code your design, using the mesh model spec, if you like.
 
Use Meshplay UI or meshplayctl to manage [designs](../tasks/patterns.md).

## Pattern Management Through Meshplay UI

Meshplay also comes with seed patterns when users start Meshplay for the first time. These patterns cover common use cases and examples for you as you explore Meshplay.

Users can also import these patterns to their remote provider from this [sample repository](https://github.com/service-mesh-patterns/service-mesh-patterns/tree/master/samples).

Once these patterns are imported, you can then edit these patterns or use the pattern configurator to configure them according to your requirements.

## Pattern Management Through Meshplay CLI

You can also manage cloud native patterns through Meshplay's CLI, meshplayctl.

The `meshplayctl pattern` subcommand lets you import and apply patterns to your cluster.

For example, if you have your pattern written in a file say, `istio-bookinfo.yaml` which deploys Istio service mesh and onboards the BookInfo app on Istio, you can use meshplayctl to apply this pattern as shown below:

```
meshplayctl pattern apply -f istio-bookinfo.yaml
```

If you already have a pattern imported into Meshplay, you can apply the pattern by name.

```
meshplayctl pattern apply BookInfoApp
```

This will apply the pattern BookInfoApp, which has already been imported into Meshplay.

See [meshplayctl pattern subcommand section](../reference/meshplayctl/#cloud-native-pattern-configuration-and-management) for more details on the `pattern` subcommand.

## WASM Filters

Meshplay can be used for managing WebAssembly Filters through the UI or the CLI.

### Filter Management Through Meshplay UI

Like patterns, Meshplay also comes with some sample WebAssembly Filters for you to experiment.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/configuration-management/meshplay-filters.png" width="50%" />

You can also import these filters manually to your provider from the [wasm-filters](https://github.com/khulnasoft/wasm-filters) repo.

Meshplay's sample application [ImageHub](./deploying-sample-apps.md#imagehub) will let you test out configuring these filters out-of-the-box.

You can onboard ImageHub to an installed service mesh as shown below.

### Filter Management Through Meshplay CLI

You can also manage WASM filters through Meshplay's CLI, meshplayctl.

The `meshplayctl filter` command lets you import and configure WebAssembly filters.

For example,

```
meshplayctl exp filter apply -f metrics_collector_bg.wasm
```

If you already have a filter imported into Meshplay, you can configure the filter by name.

```
meshplayctl exp filter apply metrics_collector_bg
```

## Applications

Meshplay can also manage your Kubernetes applications and deploy them to any of your connected kubernetes cluster.

### Managing Applications Through Meshplay UI

Meshplay has a set of [sample applications](./deploying-sample-apps.md) which you can use to quickly test out your deployment.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/configuration-management/meshplay-applications-seeded.png" width="50%" />

You can also bring in your own applications by uploading it from filesystem or importing it from a URL.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/configuration-management/meshplay-applications.png" width="50%" />

The application files can be described in following formats:
- Kubernetes manifest
- Meshplay Design
- Helm charts
- Docker Compose Apps

You can also run the same application on multiple connected kubernetes clusters and compare the performance. See [Performance Management with Meshplay](performance-management.md) for more details.

### Managing Applications Through Meshplay CLI

The `meshplayctl app` subcommand lets you manage your custom application workloads with Meshplay.

You can onboard/offboard applications from your mesh as shown in the example below.

```
meshplayctl app onboard imagehub.yaml
```

```
meshplayctl app offboard imagehub.yaml
```
